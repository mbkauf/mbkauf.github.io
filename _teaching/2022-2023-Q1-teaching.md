Course Description
======
With unabated growth in health expenditures and health insurance premiums, increases in costs paid directly by patients, and the recognition that the most ambitious goals of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will not be achieved unless expenditures can be curbed, cost control is a central focus of health policy. However, efforts to reduce costs may be problematic if they are not done with an understanding of the value of a health care intervention. The value of an intervention considers both costs and the benefits of the intervention. The main focus of this class is to teach students how to understand and assess the value of health-care interventions. This course will teach students how to evaluate the costs, risks, and benefits of alternative health care technologies and services. What are the main issues and problems facing such evaluations?
