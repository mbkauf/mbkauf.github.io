Infectious disease modeling is an active area of my research. As part of my dissertation, I developed a method for parameterizing a multi-stratification Who-Acquires-Infection-From-Whom (WAIFW) matrix. 

My postdoctoral project is developing an infectious disease modeling platform calibrated for Minnesota that will be rapidly adaptable to a variety of pathogen types and can inform public health and health system decision-making and communication during an infectious disease emergency. The platform will allow decision makers to compare the potential impacts of a variety of policy alternatives on population health outcomes.
