I am a Health Policy PhD candidate in the Decision Sciences track at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford in 2019, I worked as an economist in the Public Health Economics Program at RTI International conducting economic evaluations in areas such as diabetes, pediatric asthma, family planning, and more. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Business Economics from the University of South Carolina and a master’s degree in Health Economics from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. My current research interests include simulation modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis, kidney transplantation policy, and cancer modeling.
