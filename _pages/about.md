I am a Midwest Analytics and Disease Modeling Center (MADMC) Postdoctoral Associate at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health. My postdoctoral research is done under the advisement of [Professor Eva Enns](https://directory.sph.umn.edu/bio/sph-a-z/eva-enns). As part of MADMC, I am developing a decision-analytic infectious disease modeling platform with the goal of supporting decision-making during public health emergencies. More about the center can be found [here](https://www.sph.umn.edu/research/centers/midwest-analytics-and-disease-modeling/). 

Prior to joining the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, I recieved my PhD in Health Policy in the Decision Sciences track at Stanford University. My primary advisor is [Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert](https://healthpolicy.fsi.stanford.edu/people/jeremy_goldhaberfiebert). I worked as an economist in the Public Health Economics Program at RTI International conducting economic evaluations in areas such as diabetes, pediatric asthma, family planning, and more. I hold a bachelor’s degree in Finance and Business Economics from the University of South Carolina and a master’s degree in Health Economics from the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. My research interests include simulation modeling, cost-effectiveness analysis, infectious disease modeling, kidney transplantation policy, and cancer modeling.
