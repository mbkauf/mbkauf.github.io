My research primarily focuses on the use and development of decision sciences methods. I have applied these methods primarily to kidney transplantation and <i> H. pylori </i>. 

Within kidney transplantation, I have researched both pediatrics and older candidates. We published an article that examined racial and ethnic disparities in pediatric kidney transplantation before and after a 2014 policy change. For older candidates, one project was a review of immunosuppression considerations. I then built and calibrated a microsimulation model of the transplant process for older candidates. I then use the calibrated model to determine the cost-effectiveness of policies that make use of suboptimal but usable deceased donor kidneys to increase the rate of transplantation for this population. 

I also model the spread of <i> H. pylori </i> in the United States using an age and race-specific dynamic transmission model. This project is part of the Harvard-Stanford model in the CISNET gastric cancer modeling group. In developing the model, we found an interesting methodological problem; how do you calibrate an age and race-specific transmission matrix? We have developed a method that leverages commonly used techniques in a novel way.
