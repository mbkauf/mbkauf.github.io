We are developing a race-specific, age-structured, susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) dynamic transmission model of <i>H. pylori</i> infection and treatment in the United States to evaluate multiple test-and-treat strategies. <br> <br>

This project is a part of the CISNET gastric cancer modeling group
