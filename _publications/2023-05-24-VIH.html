excerpt: 'Existing type 2 simulation models implement risk equations derived from UK data. This model is based on newly derived risk equations developed for the United States. This model can be used to predict remaining life-years, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years for different cohorts of type 2 patients.'

<b>Abstract</b> <br> <br>
<b>Objective</b><span>&#58;</span> To develop a microsimulation model to estimate the health effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of public health and clinical interventions for preventing/managing type 2 diabetes. <br>
<b>Methods</b><span>&#58;</span> We combined newly developed equations for complications, mortality, risk factor progression, patient utility, and cost—all based on U.S. studies—in a microsimulation model. We performed internal and external validation of the model. To demonstrate the model’s utility, we predicted remaining life-years, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and lifetime medical cost for a representative cohort of 10,000 U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes. We then estimated the cost-effectiveness of reducing HbA1c from 9% to 7% among adults with type 2 diabetes, using low-cost, generic, oral medications. <br>
<b>Results</b><span>&#58;</span> The model performed well in internal validation; the average absolute difference between simulated and observed incidence for 17 complications was less than 8%. In external validation, the model was better at predicting outcomes in clinical trials than in observational studies. The cohort of U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes was projected to have an average of 19.95 remaining life-years (from mean age 61), incur $187,729 in discounted medical costs, and accrue 8.79 discounted QALYs. The intervention to reduce HbA1c increased medical costs by $1,256 and QALYs by 0.39, yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $9,103 per QALY. <br>
<b>Conclusions</b><span>&#58;</span> Using equations exclusively derived from U.S. studies, this new microsimulation model achieves good prediction accuracy in U.S. populations. The model can be used to estimate the long-term health impact, costs, and cost-effectiveness of interventions for type 2 diabetes in the United States.<br> <br>
